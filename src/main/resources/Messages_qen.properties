# This file contains the descriptions of the message keys in English.
# It uses the ISO 639 reserved language code qen.

# Labels
label-about = Title of the about box.
label-concentration = Label for the program name.

# Menus.
# Menu keys have the following structure:
# * A regular key for the menu title.
# * Append "-mnemo" for the mnemonic key.
#   The mnemonic key is usually a letter which is part of the menu title, for quick selection of the menu.
#   For example, if the mnemonic key is Q, the key KeyEvent.VK_Q will be used.
# * Append "-accel" for the accelerator key stroke (menu items only).
#   Use a key as for the mnemonic key. You may prepend it with "C-" for a control modifier, "A-" for an Alt modifier, and/or "S-" for a shift modifier.
#   For example, if the accelerator key is "C-Q", the action is triggered by pressing Control-Q.
# * Append "-shortdesc" for a short description of the menu action (menu items only).
#   This may be used for a tooltip.
# * Append "-longdesc" for a long description of the menu action (menu items only).
#   This may be used in context sensitive help.
# Usually, only descriptions for the menu title are provided in this file.
