# Menus.
# Menu keys have the following structure:

# * Append "-mnemo" for the mnemonic key.
#   The mnemonic key is usually a letter which is part of the menu title, for quick selection of the menu.
#   For example, if the mnemonic key is Q, the key KeyEvent.VK_Q will be used.
# * Append "-accel" for the accelerator key stroke (menu items only).
#   Use a key as for the mnemonic key. You may prepend it with "C-" for a control modifier, "A-" for an Alt modifier, and/or "S-" for a shift modifier.
#   For example, if the accelerator key is "C-Q", the action is triggered by pressing Control-Q.
# * Append "-shortdesc" for a short description of the menu action (menu items only).
#   This may be used for a tooltip.
# * Append "-longdesc" for a long description of the menu action (menu items only).
