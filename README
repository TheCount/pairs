Pairs is a concentration-type game where you have to find matching card
pairs. The game begins with a number of cards turned face down. You then
may turn two cards of your choice. If they match, they are removed from
the game. Otherwise, they are turned face down again. You win if you
manage to remove all cards from the game.

To make this particular instance of concentration more interesting,
matching pairs do not consist of identical cards. Instead, one card
may bear an image, while its match may contain text spelling out what
can be seen on the image.

Building
========

You need the maven2 project builder and, of course, a java development
kit. In the source root, execute the following command:

$ mvn package

The jar will then be built in the target subdirectory.
